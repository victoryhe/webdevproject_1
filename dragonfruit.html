    <h1>Dragonfruit: A Vibrant Tropical Treat</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Dragonfruit</h2>
    <p>Dragonfruit, also known as pitaya, is a tropical fruit known for its vibrant pink or yellow skin and speckled white or red flesh. The fruit is mildly sweet, with a texture similar to kiwi or pear.</p>

    <h2>Varieties of Dragonfruit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>White-fleshed dragonfruit </li>
	  <p>This variety has pink skin, white flesh, and black seeds. It is the most commonly sold dragonfruit in the USA, probably because it is relatively sweet. Most groceries only carry one variety, so if you want something besides a white dragonfruit, check international markets.</p>
      <li>Red-fleshed dragonfruit </li>
	  <p>This variety has deep red skin and flesh. They generally arenâ€™t as sweet as other dragonfruit varieties, though the red varieties from Vietnam are said to be a bit sweeter than those from other countries.</p>
      <li>Yellow-skinned dragonfruit </li>
	  <p>The yellow varieties have yellow skin, white flesh, and are considered the sweetest type with the firmest texture of all dragonfruit. They come mostly from South America, where Colombia is the largest producer.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>Dragonfruit is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It is a good source of Vitamin C, fiber, and magnesium, making it a healthy addition to any diet.</p>

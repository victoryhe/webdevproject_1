    <h1>The Growing Crisis of Plastic Pollution</h1>

    <h2>What is Plastic Pollution?</h2>
    <p>Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife, habitat, and human health. Plastics are non-biodegradable and can persist in the environment for hundreds of years.</p>

    <h2>Sources of Plastic Pollution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Single-use plastics (bags, bottles, straws)</li>
      <li>Microplastics from cosmetics and clothing fibers</li>
      <li>Industrial waste and discarded fishing gear</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact on Marine Life</h2>
    <p>Plastic pollution has devastating effects on marine life. Animals like turtles, birds, and fish often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, which can cause injury or death.</p>
